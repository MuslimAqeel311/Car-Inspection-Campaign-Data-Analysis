# Car-Inspection-Campaign-Data-Analysis
This project focuses on leveraging advanced data science techniques to improve the outcomes of car inspection campaigns. By applying predictive modeling through deep neural networks (DNN), KMeans clustering, Bayesian statistics, and interactive visualizations using Plotly, this project aims to provide data-driven insights to optimize campaign performance.

## Key Features
###  1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
Steps to import, clean, and prepare the campaign data for analysis and modeling.
###  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Detailed exploration and analysis of campaign data related to car inspection services.
Evaluation of key metrics such as customer demographics, service usage, campaign reach, and inspection results.
###  3. KMeans Clustering
Use of KMeans clustering to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their behavior and interaction with the campaign.
Clustering insights are used to tailor campaign strategies for different customer segments.
###  4. Advanced Visualization with Plotly
Interactive and visually appealing data visualizations created using Plotly.
Heatmaps, scatter plots, and line graphs used to detect patterns, relationships, and trends in the campaign data.
###  5. Bayesian Statistics
Application of Bayesian statistics to model uncertainties and provide more robust predictions.
Bayesian inference used for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification in the car inspection campaign.
###  6. Predictive Modeling with Deep Neural Networks
Implementation of a deep learning model (DNN) to predict critical campaign outcomes, such as customer engagement, revenue impact, and service utilization based on campaign data.
### 7. Conclusion
Summarizing insights from the data analysis, modeling, and clustering.
Recommending strategies for improving future car inspection campaigns.
